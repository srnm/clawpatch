# Changelog

## 0.3.1 - Unreleased

- Added `clawpatch ci` to initialize, map, review, write a report, and append a GitHub Actions step summary in one CI-friendly command.
- Added `clawpatch open-pr --patch <id>` to turn an applied patch attempt into an explicit GitHub pull request.
- Added review prompt provenance and budget accounting for included files, omitted files, prompt bytes, and approximate tokens.
- Added retries for transient acpx JSON review failures via `--prompt-retries` and `CLAWPATCH_REVIEW_RETRIES`, thanks @coletebou.
- Hardened review ingestion so provider findings must cite included files with valid line ranges and matching evidence quotes.
- Fixed provider review to preserve valid sibling findings when per-finding schema or evidence validation fails, recording drops in `run.errors` as non-fatal `schema-drop` or `validation-drop` entries, thanks @coletebou.
- Improved provider schema validation failures so `run.errors[].message` shows compact one-line Zod issue summaries, thanks @coletebou.
- Added `total` and `results` aliases on `clawpatch report --json` output while keeping the legacy `findings` count, thanks @coletebou.
- Fixed `clawpatch open-pr` so repositories without default-branch metadata use a dedicated patch branch and let GitHub choose the PR base.
- Fixed `clawpatch open-pr` retries to push the recorded patch commit instead of any later local branch tip.
- Fixed first-time `clawpatch open-pr` branch creation to start from the recorded patch base.
- Fixed command execution so providers that exit before reading stdin do not surface benign `EPIPE` errors.
- Fixed `clawpatch ci --since` empty-review output so it reports `reviewed: 0`.
- Fixed formatter configuration so `oxfmt` uses two-space indentation consistently across platforms.
- Added generic package-less monorepo app-root mapping for Node/Next projects under roots such as `apps/*` and `packages/*` when positive source or framework signals are present.
- Added Maven project mapping for root, nested, and multi-module Java/Kotlin projects with Spring role slices, Maven validation defaults, and `pom.xml` detection, thanks @julianshess.
- Added a release-prep checklist for auditing changelog, package metadata, and dry-run package contents without publishing.
- Improved bounded source grouping so large flat directories split repeated filename families like command, plugin, doctor, and runtime files into more coherent review slices.
- Improved OpenCode malformed JSON diagnostics with output length, event kinds, and a bounded preview, thanks @rohitjavvadi.
- Fixed finding signatures so equivalent evidence remains stable across re-reviews, thanks @rohitjavvadi.
- Fixed provider exit-code classification for stdout-only authentication and quota failures, thanks @rohitjavvadi.
- Improved Node route mapping to preserve literal Express and Hono mount prefixes, thanks @rohitjavvadi.
- Improved Flask route mapping to preserve static blueprint URL prefixes, thanks @rohitjavvadi.
- Improved Django route mapping to preserve literal `include()` route prefixes, thanks @rohitjavvadi.
- Fixed Express route mapping for aliased Router imports that follow block comment banners, thanks @rohitjavvadi.
- Fixed Laravel route mapping to include array-style `Route::group` prefixes, thanks @rohitjavvadi.
- Fixed Fastify route-object mapping to emit static method arrays while ignoring dynamic entries, thanks @rohitjavvadi.
- Fixed Fastify plugin callback route mapping for typed parameters and plugin aliases, thanks @rohitjavvadi.
- Fixed FastAPI route mapping to include static `APIRouter(prefix=...)` values, thanks @AsishKumarDalal.
- Added `--include-dirty` to review, CI, and revalidation file filters for auditing uncommitted worktree changes, thanks @AsishKumarDalal.
- Fixed Bun package-manager detection to recognize the text `bun.lock` lockfile, thanks @austinm911.
- Fixed review-output schema to tolerate optional `reproduction` and `minimumFixScope` fields and zero-valued evidence line numbers (normalized to `null`), recovering 4 of 28 zod issue patterns observed in run `20260517T190759-3c9e9e` (78 errors over 1000 features) that previously dropped whole-feature output instead of the affected finding.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-05-18

- Added explicit Codex reasoning effort selection via `--reasoning-effort`, `CLAWPATCH_REASONING_EFFORT`, and provider config, with `doctor` reporting the active setting.
- Added `CLAWPATCH_CODEX_SANDBOX` for overriding Codex provider sandbox mode when the host already provides isolation, thanks @IAMSamuelRodda.

- Fixed .NET mapping to avoid including `NuGet.config` in review context and to reject stale or commented solution project entries when choosing validation defaults.
- Improved Node workspace mapping with richer package overview features, generic extension package context, semantic large-source splits, and stricter generated/build ownership hygiene.
- Fixed agent mapper inventory to honor Git ignored files, nested worktrees, and configured include/exclude filters, thanks @amiable-dev.
- Fixed provider commands with relative `--root` paths by canonicalizing explicit roots before invoking Codex or other providers.
- Improved Codex provider failures for missing Responses API write scope with direct credential and scope guidance.
- Improved `clawpatch fix` handoff context and patch-attempt changed-file auditing for dirty-worktree fixes.

- Added Turborepo task metadata mapping for workspace-aware feature validation commands.
- Added selected package script mapping for Node workspace packages.
- Added progress output for `clawpatch revalidate`, thanks @twidtwid.
- Fixed overlapping `clawpatch review` runs so feature claims use atomic lock files and can be recovered with `clean-locks`, thanks @rohitjavvadi.
